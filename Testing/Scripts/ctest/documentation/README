Files in this folder define documentation build paths. To enable 
automatic documentation build and install, place a file in this 
directory with the project name. It will be automatically parsed 
by the build system if build_documentation is set in the automated 
test configuration file.

There are two modes of operation, first the documentation can be 
installed somewhere on a local filesystem. This is most common 
for internal projects. The system also has the capability to publish 
documentation to a hosted repository. For this capability
to work, the project tested should already be hosted in the 
targeted repository.

Options should be 

<destination>|<path>|<doc_src>

<destination> is either local or git
<path> is either a local path accessible to the user, or a 
       git branch name (typically gh-pages) 
<doc_src> is the directory for the documentation to be copied to.
